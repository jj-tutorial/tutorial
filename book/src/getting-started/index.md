# Getting Started

In this first chapter, we'll be jumping right into using `jj` for a
real-world task: creating a pull request on GitHub.

Before we do that though, a quick note: this tutorial was produced for:

```bash
$ jj --version
jj 0.25.0
```

If your `jj` version is newer than that, there's a chance something has changed.

<div class="warning">
`jj` is pre-1.0 software, and therefore still makes breaking changes to its
CLI.

Don't worry, your repositories will be fine when upgrading.

If you're not just reading this online, and want to follow along, you can!
Head over to the [installation page] to find instructions on installing `jj`.

I want you to be productive immediately, so in this first chapter, we're going
to go pretty quickly, and show off the simplest way to work with `jj`. Then in
Part 2, we'll discuss some of the concepts in a bit more detail. Part 3 will
show off two different ways of working with `jj` that are great ways to get
started using it for real work.
